For some time I wanted to have an outlet to write about game development stuff that might never end up being anything more than a prototype or a test of certain idea. Sometimes (like now) I might end up writing something about web or cloud development but main focus is probably on game development topics.

After exploring some blogging platforms, I realized that having full control over the features and look & feel of my content was important to me. Adding the blogging support wasn't too difficult as I had already done the heavy lifting when I originally made the site and decided to put expandable [Netlify content management system](https://v1.netlifycms.org/) in for future needs. 

Not much else to say at this point really. Hopefully I'll manage to write something interesting in the future.
