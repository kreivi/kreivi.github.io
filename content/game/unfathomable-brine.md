Unfantomable Brine (yeah the name is mispelled) is a top-down arcade sailing game that I made for (https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-41)[Godot Wild Jam #41](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-41). As the game jam name suggests, the game was developed using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and had a time limit of nine days. During those nine days, I managed to put somewhere around 20 hours into the game. You can check out the game on the provided Itch page, where there's also a postmortem available where I summarize the successes and failures I identified with the game.

I might return to this idea in the future and try to take it further. I'm a fan of naval-themed games and would love to make one with a bigger scale myself as well.
