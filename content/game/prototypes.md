#### Turn based tactics
_Turn based tactics_ is a cooperative multiplayer game where players would order their characters to take actions in sequence and the consequences of the actions would be simulated by the AI controlling each character. Prototype is supporting basic multiplayer hosting & joining mechanisms and each player is given a character that they can then give orders to. Some of the core UMG component has been customized to easily build consistent and clear user interface with the Unreal Engine design tools.

Turn based sequencing is missing from the game and in it's current state only the crude lobby area where players can move has been implemented. Greatest inspiration for this game prototype is [Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_Alliance:_Deadly_Games) by [Sir-Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir-Tech) which we used to play as hot-seat multiplayer with couple of my buddies way back in the nineties. Prototype or source code is not currently publicly available.

#### Top down shooter
_Top down shooter_ is a prototype where I experimented how to create traditional two stick shooter. I was inspired to try it out after playing some [Helldivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helldivers) by [Arrowhead Studios](https://www.arrowheadgamestudios.com/) and wanted to have some ARPG gear collection mechanisms incorporated into the mix.

I experimented a bit with physical materials for different footstep sounds and created very basic roaming AI controlled characters that wonder around in the level. Next step would be to create gunplay as without it it's not much of a shooter. Prototype or source code is not currently publicly available.
