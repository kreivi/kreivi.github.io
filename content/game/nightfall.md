This game was created as an entry for [Godot Wild Jam #55](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-55), a game jam with the theme 'Dreams'. The jam had a time limit of nine days in total, and during those nine days, the active development time was somewhere around 15 hours.

The gameplay is a simple endless runner where the player tries to avoid obstacles that appear from the bottom of the screen. The trick is that the player can slow down the descend speed of the falling character by screaming into the microphone. Out of the 92 entries that the game jam had, Nightfall won the 'Originality' category.

As obstacles, I tried to use all kinds of crazy and absurd things you could imagine seeing in nightmares: lizard eyes, tentacles, skulls, and road signs, to name a few. The game ended up being a little too easy, and it's quite possible to survive without screaming into the microphone. Nonetheless, I had a good laugh while developing it, and winning the 'Originality' category was certainly a nice surprise.
