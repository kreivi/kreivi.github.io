*HexZen* is a very casual building game that has no scores or objectives for players to worry about. It's all about building something beautiful, one piece at a time.



It was my entry for [GoGodotJam](https://gogodotjam.com/), a game jam with a time frame limited to nine days and the theme 'Growth'. During those nine days, I managed to spend around ten hours creating the game, so it ended up quite unpolished and simple. However, I successfully implemented the core gameplay loop where players are randomly given a tile to place in the world or discard as they see fit to build some pleasing landscapes.
