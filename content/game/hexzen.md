*HexZen* is a very casual building game which has no scores or objectives for player to worry about. It's all about building something beautiful one piece at a time.

It was my entry for [GoGodotJam](https://gogodotjam.com/) game jam which had time frame limited to nine days with the theme 'Growth'. During those nine days I managed to spend around ten hours to make the game so it ended up quite unpolished and simple. However I managed to implement the core gameplay loop where player is randomly given a tile to place in the world or discard as seen fit.
