_HexZen_ is a very casual building game which has no scores or objectives for player to worry about.

It was my entry for [GoGodotJam](https://gogodotjam.com/) game jam which had time frame limited to nine days with the theme growth. During those nine days I managed to spend around ten hours to make the game so it ended up quite unpolished and simple. However I managed to implement the core gameplay loop where player is randomly given a tile to place in the world or discard as seen fit.

It is playable at [Itch](https://kreivi.itch.io/hexzen) and you can check out some gameplay video and screenshots from below.
