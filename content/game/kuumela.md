*Kuumela* is an arcade game, and it was my entry for [Game Off 2020](https://github.blog/2020-10-27-github-game-off-2020/), a game jam organized by [GitHub](https://github.com/). The time was limited to a month, and during that period, I managed to spend around 15 to 25 hours creating the game from scratch.

It's built using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), and it was the first game I have ever developed using this engine. While it could use some polishing and additional graphics and effects to provide a better experience, the core gameplay loop is quite fun and surprisingly challenging for a while. That being said, I probably will not take this game any further from its current state.
