*Kuumela* is an arcade game which was my entry for [Game Off 2020](https://github.blog/2020-10-27-github-game-off-2020/) game jam organized by [GitHub](https://github.com/). Time was limited to a month and during that time I managed to use around 15 to 25 hours to make this game from scratch.

It's using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and it was the first game I have ever done a game using the engine. It still would require polishing and additions especially in the graphics and effects to give great experience but the core gameplay loop is pretty fun and surprisingly challenging for a while. That being said I probably will not take this game any further from its current state.
