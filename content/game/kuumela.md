_Kuumela_ is an arcade game and it was done for [Game Off 2020](https://github.blog/2020-10-27-github-game-off-2020/) game jam organized by [GitHub](https://github.com/). Time was limited to a month and I during that time I managed to use around 15 to 25 hours to make this game from scratch.

It's using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and it was the first game I have ever done using the engine. It could use some polishing and additions especially in the graphics and effects but the core gameplay loop is pretty fun for a while.

You can play it at [Itch](https://kreivi.itch.io/kuumela) and the source code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/kreivi/Kuumela).

You can also checkout some screenshots and gameplay video right here.
