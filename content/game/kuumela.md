Kuumela is an arcade game and it was done for [Game Off 2020](https://github.blog/2020-10-27-github-game-off-2020/) game jam organized by [GitHub](https://github.com/). Time was limited to a month and I managed to use maybe around 15 to 25 hours during that time to make this game.

It's using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and it was the first game I have ever done using the engine. It could use some polishing and additions especially in the graphics and effects but the core gameplay loop is pretty fun for a while.
