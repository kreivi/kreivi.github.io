Realizing I never done platformer before I wanted to make one. It was interesting to read and implement different detailed mechanisms (such as coyote time, input buffering etc.) that go into platformer character movement. I tried creating the character and it’s movement as reusable and configurable as possible by separating the functionality into addon for Godot.

The theme kind of stroke me mid-project as I listened a lot of synthwave music during development and started to read [Kalevala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalevala) as well.

Game is not very long and without any threats there’s no risk involved in gameplay. I wanted to introduce simple puzzle mechanisms to have some other challenge than the level navigation and jump timing. Combining colours was something that I thought earlier in another prototype so I implemented it into this game. I realize it’s not accessible at all to have mechanism rely on colours so I created simple shapes to help distingify between red, green and blue colours. It’s still not the best but it’s better than nothing.

All in all it was pretty fun project but it took me way longer than I anticipated. Goes to show that as solo developer with very limited free time you need to keep ideas small and accept the fact that it takes a long time to make relatively simple games.
